# SetUpScripts

A set of scripts for setting up Linux based servers.

## Types

### AppleTalk Server Scripts.
   
Probably the most reusable of scripts, this script is intended to be run on a freshly set up Raspberry Pi (although it will probably work on most Linux types).  This script will set up a fileserver which can be accessed from all Macs, ancient and modern, allowing files to be transferred easily from one to the other.

The other function of these scripts is to set up a PostScript print server, enabling old Macs to print to modern printers.  This functionality is currently incomplete.

### Maintenance Scripts.

This script backs up my website and renews its certificates.  It might be useful for other people too - although it does assume that your website is set up using Docker.
