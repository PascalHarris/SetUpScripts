# Security Notes
# --------------
# Database password should NOT be stored in this file
# Instead, use one of these methods:
#
# 1. System password file (recommended for system accounts):
#    - Add entry to /etc/passwd or use a separate credentials file
#    - Store in /etc/webserver-maint/db.passwd with 0600 permissions
#
# 2. Environment variable:
#    - Export DB_PASSWORD in a separate file sourced before running
#    - Use systemd EnvironmentFile if running as a service
#
# 3. Docker secrets (if using Docker Swarm):
#    - Store as a Docker secret and mount in containers
#
# 4. External secrets manager:
#    - Use tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.
